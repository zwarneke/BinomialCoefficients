# BinomialCoefficients
This repository contains two projects I wrote for my honors thesis at UNL on binomial coefficients modulo any number n. Specifically, it contains a utility to create Pascal's Triangle modulo n (with various options), as well as an actual implementation of the algorithm described in my thesis for efficient computation of binomial coefficients modulo n.

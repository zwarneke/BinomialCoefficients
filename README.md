# BinomialCoefficients
Two projects I wrote for my honors thesis at UNL on binomial coefficients modulo any number n. Contains a utility to create Pascal's Triangle modulo n (with various options), as well as an actual implementation of the algorithm described in my thesis for computation of binomial coefficients modulo n.
